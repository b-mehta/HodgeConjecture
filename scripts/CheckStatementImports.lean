# The statement does not depend on the `Other` library

The repository is split into three layers:

* `HodgeConjecture.Definitions`: definitions appearing in the statement of the conjecture;
* `HodgeConjecture.Lemmas`: results needed to build those definitions;
* `Other`: everything else.

The point of the split is that `Other` is *downstream* of the conjecture: nothing there may be
needed to state it. This file enforces that by importing the statement and inspecting the resulting
environment, so the check runs against the real import graph rather than a syntactic approximation
of it. It is built by `lake build`, and fails the build if the invariant is broken.

The complementary syntactic checks -- that every `Definitions`/`Lemmas` module really is used by
the statement, and that both umbrella modules are complete -- live in `scripts/check_import_layers.py`.
Both work on the import graph; `scripts/StatementClosure.lean` reports the stronger property, namely
which imported modules contribute no declaration to the `HodgeConjecture` term itself.
